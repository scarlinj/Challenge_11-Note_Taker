# Note Taker

## About

A simple note-taking app that runs entirely in the browser using Node.js. A user's session saves after submitting a note and can even exit the browser without having to lose their posts.

## Use Offline with Express

For offline use, in the main folder, install Express:
- npm install express

Use "Node server.js" to run the .js file in Node without an .html file.  This will open a Node.js server using Express

## Features
From the Note-taker homepage, click the "Get Started" button.
Enter a title for your new note in the "Type your note title here" space.
Enter any text or details for your note in the "Type your note text here" space.
A floppy-disk icon will appear at the top-right, next to the "+" button.  Click on the floppy-disk icon located on the top right of the page to save your note.
To access your note, simply click the title of your note as it appears in the column on the left!
